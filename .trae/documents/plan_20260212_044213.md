I will update the `pangu_brain.py` script to use the Alibaba Cloud Bailian (阿里云百炼) API endpoint and model settings.

### Changes to `pangu_brain.py`:
1.  **Update API URL**: Change from `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions` to `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions`.
2.  **Update Model Name**: Change `deepseek-chat` to `deepseek-v3` (which is the Bailian deployment code for DeepSeek V3).
3.  **API Key Handling**: I will use the key you provided (`sk-65e...`).
    *   *Security Note*: I will set this key as an environment variable in the terminal session rather than hardcoding it into the file. This prevents accidental leaks if you share the code.

### Verification:
*   I will run the updated script with your new API key to generate the "AI 相亲 App" idea and verify the JSON output.
